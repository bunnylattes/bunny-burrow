# Week 3: Scope Management

### Week 3: Study Guide

**Guiding Questions**
1. What is a scope baseline?
2. How do you create a work breakdown structure?
3. How can the scope baseline help you control scope creep?

**Performance Indicators**
1. Define *project scope* and *product scope*
2. Define *project scope management***
3. Explain the key tools and techniques for gathering and documenting project requirements
4. Explain the purpose of a *project scope statement*
5. Explain the purpose of a work breakdown structure (WBD) and a WBS dictionary
6. Create a WBS to decompose the work in a simple project
7. Explain how expert judgement can be used in defining scope
8. Identify the key benefits of validating and controlling project scope
9. Define *scope creep*

### Work Breakdown Structures (WBS)

Determining the work required is one of the key elements in the success of the project. The Project Manager works with the project team to understand the work that will be included in the project. Work that is included is said to be "in scope." Work that is not included is said to be "out of scope."

**The Work Breakdown Structure is an important technique used to decompose the higher level scope into manageable elements of work.**

PMI defines the WBS as follows:

***The Work Breakdown Structure is a deliverable-oriented, hierarchical decomposition of the work to be executed by the project team, to accomplish the project objectives and create the required deliverables. It organizes and defines the total scope of the project.***

- A WBS progressively subdivides project work into smaller, more manageable pieces of work. Each descending level of the WBS represents a more detailed definition of the project work.
- You can think of the WBS as a map or outline of the project. Major project deliverables are identified first and then broken down into sub-deliverables etc. This process is repeated until the sub-deliverable detail is small enough to be manageable.
- These are called **work packages**.
- WBS contains two kinds of tasks: summary tasks and work packages.

#### Summary Tasks
**Summary tasks** are higher-level tasks that summarize project work in some way. The number of levels of summary tasks depends on the size of the project. A few levels are probably enough for a small project. With a large or complex project, you could have many levels of summary tasks.

#### Work Packages
**Work packages** are items that represent the work that will be done. They can be scheduled, cost estimated, monitored, assigned, and controlled throughout the project life cycle.

A good rule to remember is that **if a work package is in the WBS, it gets done**. If it's not in the WBS, it doesn't get done.

- Normally, the WBS is produced through a group effort. You start by using the scope statement and deliverables to identify the **top level summary tasks**. You then break down the work that makes up each of the summary tasks into smaller chunks.
- For a small project, the entire projecvt team may be involved in breaking down the project into its components.
- For large, complex projects, the people responsible for the major deliverables are likely to meet to establish the highest levels of deliverables. Then, further details would be delegated to the people responsible for the specific work.
- In the final analysis, it is up to the project manager and the project team to decide the level of detail that is required to manage the project work. More experience: stopping at a higher level. Less experience: more detail.

### WBS Structure Formats
- A tree diagram that shows the relationships between the various summary tasks and work packages.
- An indented table tasks that are listed and each level of identation takes you further and further into the sub-deliverables of the project. Work packages are represented by those items that are not further subdivided.
- A diagram or mind-map technique.

Whatever type of work breakdown structure you use, the project definition you come up with must be adequate to allow for good control while the project is being executed.

***Defining the project is the first and most important step in the planning process. The absence of a clearly defined project plan consistently is a major reason for project failure.***
