# Communicating Effectively

### Communications
**People are individuals that need different information, requirements for communication, and different methods for communication. Projects are done by people.**
- Project managers must have skills in presentation techniques, managing meetings, as well as other interpersonal communications
- The project manager should consider:
	- Who needs the information?
	- What type of information is needed?
	- When do they need the information?
	- How will the information be delivered to them?
	- Who will deliver the information?

#### Things to Consider
- **Urgency:** If the need for information is urgent, then the communication must be frequent, accurate, and timely
- **Technology:** If the mode of communication relies upon technology, then the project team must ensure that the technology systems are in place, that they are appropriate and well understood, and used effectively
- **Project Staffing:** The communications strategy used must be compatible with the experience and expertise of the project participants
- **Project Environment:** Virtual teams will communication differently as opposed to teams that meet and operate in a face-to-face environment. Teams that are made up of people from various cultures who speak different languages or who are located in separate countries will communicate in different ways.
***Project Managers spend 80%-90% of their time communicating.***

#### Communicating with Stakeholders
**Understand the requirements of the project stakeholders. Define the type of information that is required. Determine the format of the information to be presented. Select communications strategies and document them in a Communications Management Plan.**

- Describe stakeholder communication requirements
- Describe the formatting, content, and level of detailed information to be communicated
- Identify the people responsible for communication and the people who will receive the information
- Identify the methods, tools, or technologies that will be used to convey the information
- Specify the frequency of each communication
- Describe escalation planning and guidelines when issues need to be elevated for resolution
- Outline the communication plan change management approach
- Define a glossary of common project terminology

#### Project Control Book
**Compendium of project information that is maintained in paper or electronic format. It contains a repository of information about the project which is determined by the PM.**

Usually contains:
- The project business case
- The project plan including scope, schedule, and budget information
- Problem and change control
- Copies of all project performance reports
- Copies of all meeting minutes

Any authorized person has access during the project. After the project has been closed, the project control book can be used to determine what took place during a project and may be used to support requests as diverse as providing input into new projects or supporting litigation for one that went wrong.

#### Project Meetings
- Project team, customers, project steering committee, stakeholder meetings
- Meetings may be formally schedules in the communications management plan or may occur as required
- Have regular team meetings to ensure that everyone is committed and understands the project progress
- Meetings should be held only if there is good reason to hold them!! Agenda sent out in advance so people know what is expected of them!!
- Meeting minutes should be taken
- Distribute meeting minutes to stakeholders

#### Project Status Report
**Regular report that contains information describing how the project is tracking to its plan.**
- Issues, problems, opportunities, and pending decisions related to the project
- Accomplishments in the previous reporting period
- Expected accomplishments in the upcoming reporting period
- Variance analysis comparing what was planned to what has actually been achieved
	- Project scope, schedule, and budget are the three most common elements reported in variance analysis
- Information about project resources

***By reviewing the project status report, the stakeholders are able to see how the project is performing quickly and with minimum amount of effort.***

#### Presentations
- Presentations to stakeholders
- Important to understand the needs of the audience, understanding where their interests lie, and whether they are technical or non-technical
- **Plan** a presentation beforehand
