# Customer Management
- BAs or PM have to educate customers about Agile
- Many organizations and customers are scared of the time commitment, lack of documentation, and the Agile term
	- Major customer involvement
- Two constants on any agile project are setting expecations and getting feedback
	- Continuously setting expectations is necessary because things are always going to be changing
	- The habit of meeting regularly with your customer and reviewing the current state of your project

### Customer Involvement
- Stakeholder identification, participation, and communication is essential
	- Right stakeholders: push hard to get the ppl we need
	- Cement involvement: Project charter commitments, top down support from organization
	- Manage interest: recognize and reward involvement
	- Share understanding of what done looks like: important for team and stakeholders to agree of end product
	- Show progress: deliver value regularly
	- Candidly discuss estimates and projections: show true rate of development and progress

### Customer Communication Plan
- Customers need to understand their involvement on any project but esp Agil 
	- How will their business needs be captured
	- What's their time commitments and expectations
	- When will the team involve them for project activities
	- when can they get updates
	- do they really want production code delivered after each iteration
	- how do you onboard them to the concept of less non value added doc
- Just because Agile is light on documentation, a communication plan is still required and needs to be confirmed

### Organizational Readiness
- Culture is very important for Agile projects
	- Not everyone likes the visibility and transparency that agile brings
- Make sure your customers know how agile planning works going in and where you are going to flex when reality and the plan start to differ

### Considerations when Selecting Agile
- Will you have/is there buy in for the following? For each, you will want to assess how much support you'll have
	- Frequent product releases
	- Co-location
	- Reduced docs
	- Customer availability
	- Low accuracy in estimates at beginning
- Organizational readiness should include not just end user of the release but supportinf org
- Perhaps use some out of the box methods before attempt in tailoring
- Is there a way you can swing some informal/formal training/emp development towards learning agile
- Organization Culture
- Are there software integration points with other systems?
- Team size

# Managing Customer Expectations
- 64% of features are not ever used
- Stop building waste
- Stakeholders may be challenged by the rapid, iterative development found in an agile project and the need to be on call
- A business analyst needs to help answer
	- What is the impact of the agile cadence on the stakeholder
	- How does progressive elaboration impact the expectations of the stakeholder
	- Can the stakeholder participate in updating the processes, interactions, and products specifications during the course of the project
- Map customer expectations to a Kano analysis
- As an agile project team plans for delivery it is important to hink about what is pragmatic and doable
- The team must balance capacity and demand when they estimate the work to be done to deliver
	- Done thru continuous review of team capacity, prior delivery cycle commitments and actuals, velocity trends
	- Enables the team question what can be delivered given their knowledge of the work set
	- Understanding what is doable occurs throughout any agile delivery cycle such as release planning or whenever a team is pulling new backlog items for consideration

# Personas
- Powerful and simple tool to help design software that users will benefit from
	- Prove useful in assessing the likely communication needs of specific stakeholder groups
	- May provide insight into the particular needs of a stakeholder ot the techniques that will be effective in understanding
- They are fictional characters or archetypes that exemplify the way that typical users interact with a product
- Used to understand value from the perspective of a particular customer and allow a team that may not have direct access to a customer rep to better understand their needs
- Should be describes as though they're a real person
	- Name, personality, family, work background, skill level, preferences, behaviour patterns, personal attitudes
	- Also good practice to include a photo and write a short day in the life narrative
- Personas are not user roles (such as sale person admin etc) primarily defined in terms of tasks or job
- Personals put the emphasis on goals and behaviours
- Quick guides or reminders of the key stakeholders on the project and their interests
	- May be based on profiles of real people or composites of multiple users
		- Archetypal descreiption of users
		- Grounded in reality
		- Goal oriented specific relevant
		- Tangible and actionable
		- Generate focus
- Personals are an answer to the observation that a designer who tries to please everybody ends up pleasing nobody bc too many compromises kill integrity
- Use personas when you want to get deeper understanding of key stakeholders than one generally gets from traditional role or actor
	- Help drive products that are fit for purpose and usable
- If the data is available using demographic data about intended user is good
- Identify a rep pool of personas depending on the size of the prospective user base persons may range from a handfgul to a dozen or more
	- Ranked personas to identify a few key targets that will realize the most benefit

### Advantages
- Help team members share a specific consistent understanding of various audience groups
- Data about the groups can be put in a proper context and can be understood and remembered in coherent stories
- Proposed solutions can be guided by how well they meet the needs of individual user personas 
- Features can be prioritized based on how well they address the needs of one or more personas 
- Provide a human face for empathy

### Disadvantages
- Tendency to create persona sthat embody traits that are common to most users so it's too generic
- May not be a good substitute for a real user

# Agile Communication Strategy
- Business analysis activities are planned as needed usually at the start of each iteration
	- Less of a focus on formal doc
	- Focus on progressive elaboration of documentation thru the life of project which is replaced by interactions

### Story Planning Meeting / Planning Workshops
- This is our just in time analysis checkpoint meeting
- During the Story Planning Meeting SPM we will:
	- Elaborate on the user stories for the iteration
	- Define and review the test criteria for upcoming stories
	- Estimate with the devs
	- Define any other supporting tasks

**BA Role in Planning Workshop**
- Determine the business analysis effort and activities to support a team objective and perform detaled analysis for items this iteration
- Ensuring that the intake of new work by the team matches the priorities of the stakeholders or sponsor and delivers value
- Welcome changing reqs this means that the ordering prioritizing of work items may be changed
- Arrive at a commitment to some set of functionality that the team is reasonably confident they can complete in the near future
	- May also occur whenever the team is near to completing backlog or backlog needs to be ordered
- Focus is usually on completing a Minimally Marketable Feature
	- Smallest feature set that would be marketable to customer

### Daily Team Meeting
- Also called Daily Stand Up, Daily Scrum, Huddle
- Lasts no more than 15 mins
- Typical Agenda
	- Work completed previous day
	- Work to be completed today
	- Roadblocks and issues
- Meeting provides global snapshop of the project
- Discovers any new dependencies
- Addresses any personal needs of committed individuals
- Adjusts the work plan to meet the needs of the day and ensure the team can deliver
- Frequently the dialogue held during these meetings uncovers items that lack clarity
- Stay within time
- Scrap discussing completed work

### Advantages
- Prevents common failure mode of teams where in the absence of an explicit occasion to share recent info, some critical knowledge isn't shared
- Regular sharing of info in short energetic meeting: team cohesion
- Stand up meetings shorter, more pleasant

### Disadvantages
- Tough for large teams

# Prototypes, Simulations, Demonstrations
- It is critical we confirm success and that we are providing value
- IKIWISI
	- I'll know it when i see it
- We prototype, simulate, and demonstrate to learn
	- The differences between what was asked and what was interpreted
	- Gather new or adjusted functionality

### Iteration Product Reviews Demonstration
- Show what was completed and can be deployed this iteration
- Demonstrates:
	- How the code that was developed meets the acceptance criteria
	- Fixed bugs
	- Technical work
- Product owner determines which items on the feature list have been completed
- New reqs -> Backlog
- Only show real, live code
- Fun!
- Let customer demo
- Sometimes Product Review meeting combined with Iteration Planning Meeting
- Plan the next iteration
	- The Iteration Planning Meeting is where you get together with customer to plan
	- Review team velocity, review upcoming stories, figure out how much to commit to

# Retrospective
- Team meeting to reflect on
	- What it has done well
	- What could do better
	- Agreement on improvements needed
- Held at end of each iteration
- Should include whole team
- Retrospective should be focused on identifying issues with process
- Facilitated by neutral facilitator

**Preparation:** The team prepares ideas from the recent iteration to be analyzed
**Identify the Issues:** Many mechanisms to identify the issues (post-its, themes, groups)
**Choosing Future Actions:** Ask the team to decide which solutions they want to focus on next, assign responsibility to an individual team member

### Advantages
- Excellent way for team to find collective voice
- Mid project improvement

### Disadvantages
- Team members may feel obliged to pretend they trust each other when they don't
- Only good if acted upon
- Most ideas raised are known to at least one member
