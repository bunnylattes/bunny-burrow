**Defining a Project**

- Project management operates in an environment that has a unique language, context, and processes.
- This environment affects the project and the project manager.
- Successful project managers must manage their project within this framework.
- According to the PMI PMBOK
    - ***A project is a temporary endeavour undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result.***
        - Developing a new product
        - Designing a new vehicle
        - Building a house
        - Running a fund raising campaign
        - Making a movie
        - Re-engineering a business process
- **Temporary** means that a project has a definite, well-defined beginning and end. If it seems to go on forever, it is because the objective is not defined clearly. Temporary does not necessarily apply to the product or service being created. The product is usually indefinite.
- **Unique** does not mean it is the only one in the world, but it is the only one made by that project.
- **Progressive Elaboration**:
    - When you start a project, you may not know all the details of all the things you are delivering in the project. As you progress, you must be able to develop a more detailed understanding of the objectives and the deliverables.
    - As you **progress** through the project you are able to **elaborate** on the scope and significant details of the work required to complete the project.

**Projects vs. Operations**

- Most work done by organizations can be categorized as either projects or operations.
- **Projects** are temporary and unique, the purpose of a project is to meet its objectives and then end.
- **Operations** are ongoing and repetitive, the purpose is to keep the business going. Objectives are constantly changing as the needs of the business evolve.

**Project Management**

- According to to the PMI PMBOK Guide
    - ***Project Management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to meet project requirements.***
- Project Management includes, but is not limited to:
    - Initiate the project
    - Identify project requirements
    - Determine and set project objectives
    - Execute the project activities
    - Manage and control the quality, scope, time, and cost
    - Identify and manage risk
    - Satisfy project stakeholders
    - Manage project change
    - Close the project
- Contributes to the success of the project and technical quality of the project or service the project is delivering. A project that is not managed properly rarely succeeds.
- Using Project Management skill, you can:
    - Effectively define and manage the project scope
    - Determine the costs of a project, build a project budget, and track and control the costs and budget as the project proceeds
    - Develop, track, and manage a project schedule
    - Determine the resources (people, materials, and equipment) that are required to deliver the project objectives
    - Manage project communications; 80-90% of a project manager’s job is communication

**Key Factors of Project Management**

- Scope
- Time
- Cost
- Quality

***Triple Constraint refers to the scope, time, and cost. All three need to be balanced to manage a project. As one factor changes, one or both of the others will also change.***

- If you are asked to do more work (scope increase), then it is likely that the project will take longer and cost more (time increase, cost increase).
- If you are told to finish earlier (time decrease), you may have to cut back on some deliverables (scope decrease) or add in more resources (cost increase).

**The Project Context**

- Understanding where your project fits into the big picture can help you manage the project better.
- PMI PMBOK defines program as
    - ***A Program is a group of related projects managed in a coordinated way to obtain benefits and control not available from managing them individually.***
- Ex: An auto manufacturer bringing a new car to market sets up a program to develop and introduce the vehicle: a design project, a sales project, a manufacturing project, service and parts project. All of these can be a part of the Program.
- Projects can be subdivided into management components called **subprojects** which is just an arbitrary splitting of the Program.

***A Portfolio is a collection of projects or programs and other work that is grouped together to make it easier for an organization to meet broader, strategic business objectives.***

- The individual elements in the portfolio may not necessarily be related or interdependent. Typically, a portfolio has goals of its own to achieve and is managed by senior level managers within the organization.
- Ex: Software Application company may have several related products that it wants to include in its portfolio of product offerings:
    - A strategic plan that identifies the key industry sectors it wants to develop software for
    - A program to coordinate the activities for each individual product
    - A set of other programs divided into multiple projects and subprojects.

***Project Management Office (PMO) is a specialized area within the company that centralizes and coordinates the management of projects.***

- Some organizations use the PMO simply to support clerical and financial admin of projects
- Other PMOs assume responsibility for all aspects of project management including assigning Project Managers, defining standards, training, tools, software, and so on.

***Projects are typically divided into groups of logically related activities called Phases which allow for better control over the project and divide the project into manageable sections.***

- Collectively, these project phases are known as the **Project Lifecycle.**
- Each phase will produce one or more deliverables.
    - A deliverable is any tangible, measurable, and verifiable outcome, results, or item that must be produced to complete a project or part of a project.
- Typical project lifecycles are defined in the PMBOK

***A process is a set of interrelated actions and activities that are performed to achieve a pre-specified set of products, results, or services.***

- Good management practice has shown that the application of **project management processes** to a project will improve the chances of having a successful project.
- For example, one process has an output that leads to the next process.
- Project management processes can be organized into five groups of one or more processes each:
    - **Initiating Processes**
        - Processes related to starting a project. They include activities that allow a reasonable definition of what the project needs to achieve.
            - Determining the project objectives
            - Identifying the reasons for launching
            - Giving basic description of the high level project scope
            - Determining deliverables
        - Two key documents are produced:
            - **Project Charter** which defines the rationale for the project
            - **Preliminary Scope Statement** which provides initial, high level definition of what the project will do
    - **Planning Processes**
        - Used to gather information from many sources and assemble it into a **Project Management Plan**
        - The project management plan identifies and defines the project scope, costs, schedule, and activities. Dependencies between activities are determined, risks are analyzed, and contingency plans are made. Stakeholder requirements are determined and are factored into the project.
        - This can carry out through the project as new information is discovered.
    - **Executing Processes**
        - Carry out the project plan by performing the activities identified.
    - **Controlling Processes**
        - Consists of those things done to observe the project execution and monitor it so that progress can be reported and problems can be detected and resolved quickly.
        - Project performance is tracked against the project plan, any deviations from that plan such as slippages in time, scope creep, risks occurring, and so on are identified and monitored.
        - Actions to correct these deviations are planned, approved, and executed.
    - **Closing Processes**
        - Describe the project and admin things needed to bring the project to an orderly end.
        - Includes: disbanding the project team, looking at lessons learned, and closing out any third party contracts.

**Organization Structures**

- Projects are part of an organization larger than the project itself. The maturity of the organization’s structure, its project management system, culture, style, and departmental structures influence the management of the project.
- The Project Manager needs to be aware of the different type of organizational structures so their project management approach can be tailored to take this into consideration.


### Key Roles and Responsibilities

**Reflection Questions**
1. Think about what you believe would be important factors you would use to select a project manager. Are there certain characteristics you would avoid?
2. What other skills do you feel might be important for a project manager? Are these skills different depending upon the type of project or the type of product being developed?
3. Are there any other key project roles you can think of? Are these roles unique to certain types of projects? Certain industries?

**Stakeholders**

***A project stakeholder is an individual or organization involved in a project, or those whose interests may be positively or negatively affected as a result of project execution or completion***

- They are not always clearly identified
- They need to be identified because they influence your goals and objectives as well as outcomes
- You must understand their needs and expectations

**Project Manager Responsibilities**
- Co-ordinate all the efforts of the project team to achieve a successful result
- Communicate effectively
- Lead the project team by example and solve problems
- Make project decisions
- Build a supportive atmosphere
- Understad the business problem that is solved by the project
- Ensure the quality of the project and the product it delivers

**Project Team**
- Choosing project team members is based upon skills required to perform the project tasks
	- Previous experience and performance in similar work
	- Personal interests
	- Team player
	- Availability
	- Competency and ability

**Project Sponsor**
- Champions the project and uses their influence to gain approval for the project, usually a high level executive in the organization
- The project manager's source of help because the success of the project rests with the customer and the Project Sponsor has the power to provide


### Leadership

- On most project, a high degree of uncertainty is often encountered; if difficulties arise between team members and project objectives general management may not be enough, strong leadership is required.
- **Management by Walking Around** 
	- Communicates with your team members and identify conflict or problems that need to be resolved
	- Touch base with the team
- **Leading by Example**
	- Demonstrate leadership through own behaviour; project members will model their own behaviour according to what they see project leaders doing
- **Leadership is a set of skills you can learn and polish through study and practice.**
