# Week 9: Agile Business Analysis

### Waterfall Development Model
- Popular version of the systems development life cycle model
	- Classic
	- Linear sequential
	- Distinct goals in each phase, there is no turning back
	- Requirements/Analysis -> Design -> Coding -> Testing -> Maintenance

#### Waterfall Requirements Definition
- Business Analyts are conditioned to believe that they can and should define detailed reqs at the beginning
- Challenges with this assumption:
	- The customer cannot definitively know, articulate, and define what the software should do
	- Requirements can change
	- There is inherent uncertainty in software development
	- Attempting to define everything up front results in constant change management

#### Why Agile?
- Most organizations need:
	- Faster product delivery
	- More efficient practices
	- Drive toward value
- Face a host of practical problems
	- Products are complex and therefore expensive to build and maintain
	- Customers are getting more savvy and demanding
	- Requirements risks
	- People: Products are discovered and delivered by teams of human beings

### What is Agile Development?
- A collection of software development methods based on iterative development
	- Requirements and solutions evolve
	- Focus on delivering value sooner with higher quality
	- Customers directly involved
	- Teams self organized
		- People driven instead of driving people
	- Break big problems down into small ones

#### Key Attributes of Agile Development
- Methods not new but perceived as such
	- Officially 11 years old
- Considered to be a lightweight methodology
- Breaks deliverables into smaller chunks: iterations
- Focus on close collabs with dev team
- Focus on face to face communication

#### Agile Requirements Definition
- To effectively deal with scope on an Agile project, specifications must be considered in two dimensions:
	- Breadth first
	- Depth second
- Dealing with the breadth of the solution helps the team understand scope and cost and will facillitate estimating and release planning
	- Frames the boundaries of the project and helps to manage expectations
	- Much smaller investment of time and resources than dealing with entire depth
- The details are most likely to evolve so defining them early has less value

***Higher customer involvement yields higher customer satisfaction*

### Waterfall Development: Advantages
- Allows for departmental and functional managerial control
- Experienced developers typically love it
- Thought to be the easiest to define scope, plan, and document the plan due to linear nature - predictability
- Can be easier to manage geographically dispersed teams
- Can be best for firm, well-defined scope

### Waterfall Development: Disadvantages
- Does not allow for much reflection or revision
- Assumes requirements can't change and detracts from accepting change reqs
- Creation of large amounts of non-value adding documentation
- Often is paired with low user involvement
- Once feature is in testing stage, very difficult and expensive to go back

### Agile Development: Advantages
- Can excel on projects with ambiguous goals, objectives, and reqs
- Delivers a minimum viable product quickly
- End result viewed to have higher quality
- Increases visibility of project team work, better co-ordination
- Adaptability: Able to respond to customer wants and deliver value quicker than waterfall

### Agile Development: Disadvantages
- Agile can be a dirty word
	- Not well understood or considered threatening by devs
- Some core tenants difficult to achieve
	- Colocation
	- Extensive time from product owner or key user contributors
	- Self directed teams
- Lack of experience on executing projects without the detailed estimates and scope up front
	- PMs don't know where to start
	- "We won't know until what can be done by the team how to forecast."

**It doesn't have to be all agile or all waterfall**

## Agile Manifesto
- www.agilemanifesto.org
- Uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it
- 4 Key Values:
	- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
	- Working software over comprehensive documentation
	- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
	- Responding to change over following a plan

### 12 Principles of the Agile Manifestor
- **Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software**
	- Development in chunks
	- Early allows focus on customer needs
- **Welcome changing reqs, even late in development- processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage**
	- Allows the most important features to be met
	- Less time performing change management
- **Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to shorter timescale**
	- Fail faster
	- Increases project buy-in and momentum
- **Business people and devs must work together daily throughout the project**
	- Preferably, interactions are in person
	- Access to customer ensures greater customer satisfaction
- **Build projects around motivated individuals: give them the environment and support they need and trust them to get the job done**
	- Right person for the right job
	- Give variety, autonomy to plan to motivate and ensure engagement
- **The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a dev team is face to face convo**
- **Working software is the primary measure of progress**
- **Agile processes promote sustainable development: the sponsors, devs, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely**
	- Work in Progress or pull system from a work pile
	- Unlike some of the Rapid Application Development (RAD) techniques preceding Agile
- **Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility**
	- Design well to minimizer refactoring
	- Ensures long-term value by not becoming difficult to maintain, change, or extend
- **Simplicity: the art of maximizing the amount of work not done is essential**
	- Focus on delivering only what was requested
- **The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self organizing teams**
	- Focus on individuals with initiative looking for challenges
- **At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behaviour accordingly**

### What is an Iteration?
- A timebox during which development takes place, the duration of which:
	- May vary from project to project, usually between 1 and 4 weeks
	- Is in most cases fixed for the duration of a given project
- Many Agile methods have an underlying assumption that a project consists exclusively of a sequence of iterations
	- Possibly with the exception of a very brief "vision and planning" phase prior to development
	- And a brief "closure" phase after it.

### Business Analyst Roles and Responsibilities in Agile
- Any member of an Agile team may participate as another role on the team
	- i.e. developers can perform Analysis, Analysts may develop
	- Most commonly a business analyst would crossover to project manager
- Business analysis is central to the success of agile projects
	- Necessary to enable a diverse group of customers to speak with a single voice
	- This work may be done by one or more members of an agile team
- Requirements are gathered and refined through an iterative process of: 
	- Planning
	- Defining acceptance criteria
	- Prioritizing
	- Developing
	- Reviewing results

### Qualities
- The success of the business analyst relies increasingly on such interpersonal skills as communication, facilitation, coaching, and negotiation
- Understanding and combining perspectives alongside the ability to hold successful conversations replace the need for formal, detailed, long term artifacts such as requirement documents
- Analysts are active participants, if not the actual facilitators, of planning, analyzing, testing, and demonstrating activities
	- Ensure product roadmap clearly defines the product's strategic alignment to the business need

### Acting as a User Proxy
- Domain Experts, Formal Users, Business or Systems Analysts are the best type
- Marketing can understand markets vs users
- Development Manager is the worst possible choice

### BA Principles in Agile
- Start with value and keep the team true to value, it is vital that the individual holding the business analysis role is paying close attention to the project's business value
- Low-fidelity artifacts serve as an enabler of business value by creating context and generating shared understanding. However, they do not replace, or even take precedence over effective collaboration and conversation
- Business analysis is about facilitating discussion and understanding. Business analysts typically do not possess the depth of understanding about the business as does the sponsor, or as much about technology as the tech team.
- Identify and communicate competing concerns and gaps in understanding between business and tech
- Assist the team to action by communicating what is required when taking the next steps and ensuring that feedback is clearly understood and acted on
- Deliver incrementally and iteratively
- Produce the smallest amount of coumentation and deliver it at the latest possible moment.
- **In Summary:
	- Agile business analysis is about ensuring the right information is available to the development team in the right level of detail at the right time so they can build the right product.
- Agile methodologies fall into the general category of change driven approaches, as described in the BABOK guide
- Some business analysis work will generally be performed up front to define a vision for the project, but detailed analysis will be performed as needed
