# Agil Business Analysis

### Waterfall vs Agile Business Analyst Tools
- In non-Agile Development, typical business analyst tools are used such as:
	- Cause and Effect Diagrams
	- Problem Symptom Reduction
	- Affinity Mapping
	- Business Process (Activity) Diagramming
	- Interviewing
	- Getting Samples
	- Job Shadowing
- In Agile, dispense without those thattake significant amount of time to perform or require significant documentation in favour of those that quickly uncover a large amount of information (breadth) with a high degree of team (customer & development) participation
- Emphasis on surfacing all features, issues, problems, and prioritizing regularly and frequently to ensure customer value is provided

### Common Principles to Agile Analysis
- **Just Enough**: about doing whatever it takes to make the work ready; nothing more, nothing less
	- Small co-located team with customer onsite won't need a lot of formal documentation
	- Medium sized team, perhaps geographically dispersed, might need one
	- Large teams with distributed teams will need more
	- No one right level of detail
- **Just In Time**: about doing the deep dive analysis on your user story just before you need it

### Collaborative Games
- Encourages participants to collaborate in building a joint understanding of a problem or a solution
	- Use during planning workshops, requirements elicitation, retrospectives, or whenever you require active stakeholder/team participation
- Agile practices emphasize the importance of continual collaboration between project stakeholders
	- Create an environment where all project stakeholders can contribute to the overall project value and create a shared understanding

### What are Collaborative Games?
- Distinct structured techniques which include rules to keep participants focused on a specific objective
- Help the participants share their knowledge and experience, identify hidden assumptions, and explore that knowledge in ways that may not occur during normal interactions
- Often benefit from the involvement of a neutral facilitator
- Involve a strong visual or tactile element
- Three steps:
	- *Opening Step*: The participants get involved, learn the rules, and start generating ideas
	- *Exploration Step*: Participants engage with each other, look for connections between their ideas, test them
	- *Closing Step*: Ideas are assessed and participants work out which ideas are likely to be the most useful and productive

#### Remember the Future
- Everyone imagines it is 2 weeks past implementation of a release
	- List all the things that need to be completed for the release to be successful
	- Post on a wall
		- Group into associated clusters and remove duplicates
- Purpose: Traditionally difficult to drive out what the system should do/purpose

#### Prune the Product Tree
- Draw a big tree with branches
- Tree is the product
	- Features are leaves
	- Trunk represents what we already know or have built
	- Group related features close to each other
- Purpose: To see how features relate to each other and give visibility to priority setting and development sequence to stakeholders

#### 20/20 Vision
- Methodology to compare feature to feature (written on cards)
- Place all features face down, shuffle, pick one, and put it at the top of the list
- Relatively compare priority of each new feature to each feature on the list

#### Worst Nightmare
- Ask participants to imagine their worst nightmare related to product/service
- Present to the group and listen to descriptions to discover hidden or unconsidered scenarios

# Business Capability Analysis
- Generate a shared understanding of the outcomes of a business or product and identify alignment with a strategy/specific performance gaps
	- Business capabiliies describe the ability of a business to act on or transform something that helps achieve a business goal or objective
	- Business capability analysis is the analysis of the performance and risk associated with a set of business capabilities to identify specific performance gaps and to prioritize these based on business value and risk
- Business value is something that
	- Increases or protects revenue
	- Reduces or prevents cost
	- Improves service 
	- Achieves compliance
	- Positions the company for the future in alignment with the business strategy

### Business Capability Model
- Performance Expectations
	- When a capability is targeted for improvement, a specific performance gap can be identified
	- The difference between the current and desired performance
- Risk Model
	- Risks in the performance of the capability fall into the following categories:
		- Business, Tech, Organizational, Market
- Strategic Planning
	- Business capabilities for the current state and future state of an organization can be used to determine where that organization needs to go in order to accomplish their business strategy and imperatives

#### Advantages
- Result in a shared articulation of outcomes, strategy, and performance
- Helps identify opportunities that are not tech based, including process, talent, and data improvements
- Helps align these initiatives across multiple aspects of the organization

#### Disadvantages
- Requires an organization to agree to collab on this model
- Requires a broad, cross-functional collab in defining the capability model and the value framework
- Can be difficult to read (colours)

#### Implications for Agile
- Must be revisited for each release planning session
	- For scrum, this is every 2-4 weeks
- Team must maintain a constant view of the business capabilities required for the business to be successful and are in scope for the product being delivered

# Purpose Alignment Model
- Used to assess ideas in the context of customer and business value
- The model aids in making prioritization decisions and focusing investment on those features or capabilities that are of greatest value to the organization
- Used to rate activities, processes, products, or capabilities in two dimensions, and then recommend the best actions to take to improve them based on those ratings
	- Does the activity creat market differentiation?
	- Is the activity critical for the continued functioning of the organization?

#### Purpose Alignment Model

### Advantages
- Simple, can be taught to business sponsors and users in a couple of minutes so they can critically assess an idea themselves
- Can be applied all the way up and down the investment decision process, from strategic investment down to an individual feature in a system
- It is fast and entire backlog can be analyzed quickly

# MoSCoW Prioritization
- **Must Have** - Stories that must be delivered for the current business problem to be addressed, must haves are minimum usable subset
- **Should Have** - Stories that are critical to the success of the release. Should stories are as important as Must stories but may not be time critical or may have a work around
- **Could Have** - Less critical
- **Would Like** - Likely not included, but maybe some day
- Identifies the most critical set of features or stories that will ndeliver business value
- Provides a mechanism for priotizing stories in a backlog across multiple releases
- *Advantages*: Easy to describe and typically powerful in prioritizing backlogs
- *Disadvantages*: Can be subjective, if there is not effective collab with the business, this method of priotization can be inaccurate
- On a project where a business value incremental approach (Minimum Marketable Features) is used, the team should only deliver Must Haves; MoSCoW is therefore inappropriate
