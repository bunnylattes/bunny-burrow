# Risk Management

### Guiding Questions
- What are the processes used for managing project risks?
- What are some strategies for addressing positive and negative risks
- What purpose does a risk register serve?
	- A risk register categorizes the risks, states the probability, impact, risk score, risk ranking, risk response, trigger, and risk owner. It is used to track risks and associated mitigation strategies. 

### Performance Indicators
- Define ***project risk management*
- Identify the key benefits of planning risk management and identifying risks
- Describe checklist analysis, assumptions analysis, and SWOT analysis
- Differentiate between qualitative risk analysis and quantitative risk analysis
- Explain the purpose of a probability & impact matrix
- Explain four strategies for addressing negative risks (threats)
- Explain four strategies for addressing positive risks (opportunities)
- Create a risk register

### Key Definitions & Terms

- **Project Risk Management:** Includes the processes of conducting risk management planning, identification, analysis, response planning, and controlling risk on a project.
- **Key Benefit of Planning Risk Management:** To establish the framework in which the project team will identify risks and develop strategies to mitigate or avoid thosr risks.
- **Key benefit of Identifying Risks:** Will make management aware of the top risks for the project and the nature of the risks.
- **Checklist Analysis:** A technique for systemically reviewing materials using a list for accuracy and completeness.
- **Assumptions Analysis:** A technique that explores the accuracy of assumptions and identifies risks to the project from inaccuracy, inconsistency, or incompleteness of assumptions.
- **SWOT Analysis:** Analysis of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of an organization, project, or option.
- **Risk Register:** A document in which the results of risk analysis and risk response planning are recorded.
- **Key Benefit of Qualitative Risk Analysis:** Must determine the probability and impact of each risk in order to allow the project manager to prioritize the risk avoidance and mitigation strategy. Risks which are more likely to occur and have a significant impact on the project will be the highest priority risks while those which are more unlikely or have a low impact will be a much lower priority. 
- **Probability and Impact Matrix:** A grid for mapping the probability of each risk occurence and its impact on project objectives if that risk occurs.
- **Key Benefit of Planning Risk Responses:** To ensure compliance with the constraints.
- **Key Benefit of Controlling Risks:** Can add flexibility as a last resort.
- **4 Strategies for Addressing Negative Risks (Threats)**
	- ***Risk Avoidance:*** A risk response strategy whereby the project team acts to eliminate the threat or protect the project from its impact.
	- ***Risk Transference:*** A risk response strategy whereby the project team shifts the impact of a threat to a third party, together with ownership of the response.
	- ***Risk Mitigation:*** A risk response strategy whereby the project team acts to reduce the probability of occurence of impact of risk.
	- ***Risk Acceptance:*** A risk response strategy whereby the project team decides to acknowledge the risk and not take any action unless the risk occurs.
- **4 Strategies for Addressing Positive Risks (Opportunities)**


**Before risk management begins, it is imperative that a foundation is established for providing structured project information. The following project elements must be completed and defined prior to developing the Risk Management Plan:**

***Define work scope, schedule, resources, and cost elements***
- Develop project WBS/WBS dictionary
- Develop master schedule and detailed schedules
- Estimate project cost and finalize budget
- Identify required and available resources
- Establish performance measurement metrics

***Define minimum and maximum baseline thresholds***
- Schedule
- Resources
- Cost

***Baseline reporting requirements***
- Format
- Frequency of distribution
- Distribution list

***Define Risk Management Roles and Responsibilities***
- Project Manager chairs the risk assessment meetings
- Project team participates in risk assessment meetings and members serve as meeting recorder and timekeeper
- Key stakeholders participate in risk assessment meetings
- Project Sponsor may participate in risk assessment meetings

### Top 3 Risks
*It is important to explicitly state the top three risks to the project in the Risk Management Plan. This will make management aware of the top risks for the project and the nature of the risks.*

- State the risk, and then explain the reasons for the risk.
