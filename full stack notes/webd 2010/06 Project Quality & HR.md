# Week 6: Project Quality & Human Resource Management

### What is Project Quality?
- Typically measured by how well you meet the customer's requirements
- Customer satisfaction is achieved when the project manager and the project team understand, evaluate, define, and manage expectations sdo that the customer's requirements are met
- Both the quality of the project and product must be considered and planned for

### Quality Management Plan
- A quality management plan is developed to help the project meet its quality objetives. A quality management plan is usually made up of three key parts:
	- *Identify the quality standards required in this project*, the goal is to meet the standards you set. No less, no more.
	- *Define a quality assurance plan.* Document how you will demonstrate that the quality standards have been met. Quality can be demonstrated in many forms including formal project audits, lessons learned, and project reviews.
	- *Define the quality control process.* This describes how you will monitor and measure quality of results. Figure out ways to eliminate causes of unsatisfactory performance by improving and adjusting processes and measurements, and then make updates to the PMP.

**In many organizations, internally recognized quality standards may be part of the corporate culture. These include:**
- ISO Quality Standards
- Total Quality Management (TQM)
- Six Sigma
- Failure Mode and Effectr Analysis (FMEA)
- Design Reviews
- Advance Product Quality Planning (APQP) and others

#### Prevention over Inspection
- The cost of preventing mistakes is generally much less than the cost of correcting mistakes.
- Quality is planned, designed, and built in and is not inspected in.
- It is a good idea to plan to do things right the first time.

#### Adequate Resources
- The success of a project is made possible by all members contributing to the project team.
- It is the responsibility of the project manager, the project sponsor, and the key management stakeholders to ensure that the project is given the resources it needs to succeed.

#### Continuous Improvement
- A process or approach that may be satisfactory today may not be tomorrow.
- The project team must recognize that things will constantly change and the project evolves.
- They must frequently look at project processes with a plan-do-check-act cycle in order to ensure they continually improve.
- The customer is the next person who will see the product or service your project is producting... if you were the customer, would you be satisfied?

#### Quality Control
- Performing quality control involves monitoring specific project results in order to determine whether they comply with the relevant quality standards and then finding ways to remove the causes of unsatisfactory results.
	- **Inspection**: Measuring, examining, and testing to determine whether ot not the results conform to the requirements.
	- **Control Charts**: Graphical displays of results over time to determine if the project process is under control.
	- **Pareto Diagram**: A histogram ordered by frequency of occurence. It shows how many results were generated by type or category of identified cause.
	- **Flow Charting Techniques**: Show pictorally the cause and effect of poor quality. Ex: cause and effect diagram, fishbone diagram.
	- **Checklists**: The checklist can be a simple way to ensure that quality steps are being taken.

#### Project Quality Audit
***A project quality audit or review is a structured, independent review of project activities performed to determine whether or not the project activities have met organizational and project policies, processes, and procedures.***

**The goal of the audit is to identify lessons learned so that future phases of the project or future projects may benefit.**

The project audit or review performs three things:
- **Evaluates** if the project delivered the expected benefits to all stakeholders
- **Assesses** what was done wrong and what was done right
- **Identifies** changes and improvements that can be applied to the delivery of future projects

The results of the post project review should be considered when planning the details of the next phase or the details of the next project.


### Managing the Project Team
- Communication is more than just telling someone something, you must be able to get your message across so the other person understands
- Tailor your message to your audience, consider your tone and what you say as well as your method of delivery
- Make sure that your project team understands their roles and responsibilities clearly, outline expectations clearly, give achievable goals
- Set the standard for the project, set a high one
- Let people know it's okay to succeed, encourage them to show initiative within acceptable boundaries and to make decisions when appropriate
- Make sure that the critical success targets are understood and realistic and that you've made accurate estimates
- Give people feedback quickly
	- Positive reinforcement helps build your relationship
	- Correcting negative behaviour is done sooner better than later

#### Resolving Team Conflict
- Conflict may positively support the project objectives
- Recognize conflict and take steps in a timely manner to stop it if it's negative
- Negative conflict may be disruptive to goals
- Regardless of the type of conflict, it should be addressed ASAP
- This is the PM responsibility

#### Leadership and Management
- Project team meetings
- Set project ground rules
- Build a Team identity
- Lead by example
- Walk around
