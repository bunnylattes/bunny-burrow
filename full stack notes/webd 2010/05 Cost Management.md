# Week 5: Cost Management

### Week 5: Study Guide

**Guiding Questions**
1. Why is cost management important?
2. How is a WBS used to aggregate costs? How does this relate to the cost baseline?

**Performance Indicators**
1. Define *project cost management* 
2. Identify the key benefit of estimating costs
3. Explain the purpose of a cost management plan
4. Describe several tools and techniques to estimate costs
5. Identify the key benefit of determining a budget
6. Create a budget and a time-phased budget for a simple project
7. Identify the key benefit of controlling costs

### Project Budget

- To understand a project cost, the project manager must estimate the costs of the schedule of activities
	- Labour
	- Materials
	- Equipment
	- Services
	- Facilities
	- Contingency costs
- On smaller projects, cost estimating and cost budging may be performed by a single person over a short period of time
- For larger projects, the two processes are considered separate and may be performed by completely different people in different parts of the organization
- The accuracy of the cost est increases as the project moves through the lifecycle
- The ability to influence the cost if greatest in the beginning
- There is a difference between cost and price
- Cost: real costs that organization will incur
- Price: the amount the organization is putting on the project, price could be higher or lower than cost
- The price needs to be concerned with cost- do not allow pricing pressures to compromise cost decisions
- Cost is usually measured in currency units, but sometimes estimated in people hours or days (internal projects using existing resources)

### Cost Estimate from Many Sources

**Expert Judgement**
- Uses the expertise of engineers, trades people, consultants, and other experts to determine the costs of project activities

**Analogous Estimating**
- Uses actual costs from similar projects to help determine the costs for current projects

**Parametric Estimating**
- Use parameters in a mathematical model to estimate activity costs

**Estimating Databases
- Databases of costs based on historical data re available for some types of tasks
- They are useful in application areas that are governed by standards or regular rules

**Prototyping**
- Common in IT and engineering projects, a small-scale model is produced that approximates the final product that will be manufactured
- The prototype costs are refined to determine an estimated manufactured production product cost

**Computerized Tools**
- Many computerized tools can assist with cost estimation
- Spreadsheet tools such as Excel and project management tools such as MS Project

### Top-down or Bottom-up Estimates?

**Top Down** estimating techniques can be used by someone with strong knowledge of this project or similar projects to quickly provide a high-level estimate of the costs associated with the project. It can be a very good way to get an idea of how much a project will cost when time is limited.

**Bottom Up** estimating techniques can provide a much more accurate understanding of the overall project costs because every task on the lowest level of the WBS is estimated and the results are then totaled. Key members of the project team can be involved in making the estimates so you are able to draw on more expertise and get some buy in to the results.

#### Different Degrees of Granularity
- The least accurate estimate is an ***order of magnitude estimate***. An order of magnitude cost estimate is performed during strategic planning. It is often made without detailed analysis of the project tasks. Sometimes it is described as a guesstimate, preliminary estimate, or a SWAG.
- Further refinement might give you a ***budgetary estimate***. More detailed planning information is used as input. This is also known as an "approximation" or a control estimate and is used for getting project approvals.
- The most accurate estimate is a ***definitive cost estimate***. This type of estimate is prepared from detailed, well-defined project planning information.

#### Lifecycle Costing
- A broader view 
- Includes acquisition, operation, and disposal costs
- The cost of the project and cost of the product are considered together
- Lifecycle costing can improve decision making and it is used to reduce the cost and execution time as well as to prove the quality of the project deliverables
- Multiple year projects are usually done this way

### Financial Indicators

**A number of financial indicators may be used to assess project cost performance.**
- Net Present Value (NPV)
- Rate of Return (ROR)
- Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
- Return on Investment (ROI)
- Payback Period (PP)

***These may be used to compare your project against others the organization is considering.***

### The Budget

***A project budget uses the estimated costs of individual schedule activities to establish a cost baseline for the project as a whole.***

**The Budget:**
- identifies what money will be spent, how much will be spent, and when it will be spent
- provides a record to control and predict project costs
- is used to set limits on spending authority
- is used as a tool to ensure that the finance organization has funds available in a timely manner when they are required

**Project financial performance is tracked against the budget.**
