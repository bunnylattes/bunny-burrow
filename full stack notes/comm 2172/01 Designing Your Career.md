**Elevator Pitch**

- Long form
    - I am a recent Full Stack Web Development graduate. I learned all of the major programming and web development languages and how to manage projects. I loved writing Java and developing websites using PHP, so I am looking for a full stack job that handles both front and back end. Someday, I want to develop an app.
- Short form
    - I like to write programs and design websites that are unique and functional. It’s really fun to figure out new ways to style and structure websites.
