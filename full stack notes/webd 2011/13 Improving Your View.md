## The Adapter Pattern

- When you need your System to communicate with another class (perhaps a new vender class), you can use an Adapter class to translate the request to the new vender class
- *The Adapter Pattern* converts the interfact of a class into another interface that clients expect. It allows classes to work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

## Facade Pattern

- Provides a simple, front facing interface to a more complex system, library, or API
- Improves usability of a more complex API
- Serves as a starting point for refactoring an existing code base to make it easier to use or reduce tight coupling
